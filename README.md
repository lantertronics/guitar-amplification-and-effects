# guitar-amplification-and-effects
Files for my "Guitar Amplification and Effects" class at Georgia Tech.

These particular demos should be loaded in the Falstad circuit simulator: https://www.falstad.com/circuit

These are mostly demos I made for my YouTube lecture titled Diode-Based Overdrive and Distortion Effects: https://youtu.be/otkW_q0_VIU

There's also a demo for my lecture on the Boss SP-1 Spectrum pedal: https://youtu.be/6NspXYO4HXw
